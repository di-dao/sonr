## `sonr` - Docs, Proposals, & Networks

Sonr is a combination of decentralized primitives. Fundamentally, it is a peer-to-peer identity and asset management system that leverages DID documents, Webauthn, and IPFS â€” providing users with a secure, portable decentralized identity.

Sonr is built on top of the Cosmos SDK, which is a framework for building blockchain applications in Golang. We have built the above modules to provide a decentralized identity and asset management system.

## Usage

It's recommended to install the following tools:

-   [golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)
-   [grpcui](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcui)
-   [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
-   [spawn](https://github.com/rollchains/spawn)

## Status

-   [x] **Alpha**: Closed testing.
-   [x] **Private Devnet**: May have kinks. [See projects](https://sonr.io/dashboard).
-   [ ] **Public Testnet**: Stable for non-enterprise use. [Join it](#).
-   [ ] **Mainnet**: Coming soon. [Watch status](#).

We are currently in transitioning to Public Testnet. Watch [releases](https://github.com/didao-org/sonr/releases) of this repo to get notified of major updates.

## Architecture

Sonr is a [blockchain node](https://sonr.io/dashboard) which you can run locally, or use to join our testnet. You can sign up and start using Sonr without installing anything using our [dashboard](https://sonr.io/dashboard).

See [additional details](https://sonr.io/whitepaper) on these components in the whitepaper.
