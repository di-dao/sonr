# Overview

The highway is a single binary which allows for interfacing with the Sonr Blockchain (see **'Using the CLI'** for information on commands). The highway is also equipped with a REST server.  The following is a diagram outlining the topology of highway and available features.

We believe the best way to onboard the next billion users is to create a cohesive end-to-end platform thatâ€™s composable and interoperable with all existing protocols. For this, we built our Networking layer in Libp2p and our Layer 1 Blockchain with Starport. Our network comprises of two separate nodes: Highway and Motor, which each have a specific use case on the network. In order to maximize the onboarding experience, we developed our own Wallet which has value right out of the gate!
