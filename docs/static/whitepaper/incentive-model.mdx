description: Token Rewards for protocol integration and network availability
---

In order to maximize buy-in and network availability for the Sonr ecosystem, we will be implementing an empirical Token Rewards mechanism. Rewards are a way to create inflation in order to dilute the token value, resulting in an affordable onboarding and operational experience for the end user. The goal behind Sonr Token rewards is to subsidize Highway based computation, in order to promote value creation and platform growth.

The Service module provides several key functionalities, including WebAuthn-based user authentication, Service Record management and registration, and DNS resolution and record verification.

## IPFS Storage Replication
When deploying standalone core nodes, requiring minimum stake would be an additional method to enforce availability requirements. By having a stake we can ensure that the user deploying a node has a base level of buy-in within the ecosystem.

## MPC Account Generation
The generative account incentive model works by having a validator generate a new account and place it in an unclaimed accounts list. When a user requests a new account, they are given the creation options for the oldest unclaimed account. The user then generates a WebAuthn credential and submits it to the Highway. The Highway verifies the challenge and broadcasts the DID document to the blockchain. The user is then given a success message.

The generative account incentive model creates a predictable flow of token minting which fluctuates based off Network ingress. Aside from this our model offers a number of benefits over traditional account creation methods, including:
- **Increased Security** - MPC ensures that user accounts are secure and that user data is private.
- **Improved Privacy** - WebAuthn allows users to create accounts without revealing their personal information.
- **Reduced Costs** - The generative account incentive model eliminates the need for expensive hardware and software solutions.
