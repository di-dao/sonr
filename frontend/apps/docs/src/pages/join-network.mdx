# Join our Testnet

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Protocol API. We'll cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Protocol API, you will need to grab your
  API key from your dashboard. You find it under [Settings &raquo; API](#).

## Setup your Node

The following steps will help you configure your local node to connect to the Sonr testnet.

**1. Initialize a blockchain node**

```sh
sonrd init localnet
```

**2. Generate account keys**

```sh
sonrd keys add test-validator
```

**3. Add the account to the genesis file**

```sh
sonrd add-genesis-account $(sonrd keys show test-validator -a) \
  1000000000000000000000000000stake,1000000000000000000000000000snr
```

**4. Generate a genesis transaction**

```sh
sonrd gentx test-validator 1000000000000000000000000000stake --chain-id localnet
```

**5. Collect genesis transactions**

```sh
sonrd collect-gentxs
```

**6. Validate the genesis file**

```sh
sonrd validate-genesis
```

**7. Start the blockchain node**

```sh
sonrd start
```
