# Fundamentals

## The Sonr Network

Sonr is fundamentally a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol built on a multi-asset, 
Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain. The Sonr network is essentially a mesh of nodes that 
communicate over the Sonr protocol.

Built with [Cosmos SDK](https://docs.cosmos.network/), the Sonr blockchain can natively
interoperate with other blockchains through the 
[Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc).
