# FAQ

A Collection of commonly asked questions about Sonr, sourced from developers, founders and investors. {{ className: "lead" }}

## What is the Sonr stack?

- **Network** We've built a global decentralized network that leverages our breakthrough identity module allowing for device based authentication, realtime content delivery, and true digital asset ownership. Users are provided the promised utility of Web3 without any lagging experience.
- **Motor** The Sonr Motor node is an end to end client suite which provides all the features of our Network in an easily approachable SDK. Motor offers the easiest consumer onboarding experience in Web3 by stripping away seed phrases, and introducing multi-party computation for Quantum computing resistant encryption.
- **Blockchain** The Blockchain is the perfect marriage for Sonr's global decentralized network. With Cosmos, we can quickly and easily connect to other blockchains, providing our users with the ability to build interoperable experiences. IBC is the perfect specification for cross-chain communication, and GravityBridge provides us with the perfect way to bridge to Ethereum. Sonrâ€™s blockchain also provides developer with the peace of mind of knowing that user data is securely distributed across IPFS with a native bridge to Filecoin.

## What is limiting crypto adoption?

There are several factors that may prevent the widespread adoption of web3 mobile apps. Some of the main challenges and barriers to the adoption of web3 mobile apps include:
              - Limited awareness and understanding of web3 and decentralized technologies among the general public
              - Limited adoption of decentralized technologies and infrastructure by developers and businesses
              - Limited availability of user-friendly web3 mobile apps and tools
              - Limited scalability and performance of decentralized networks and applications
              - Regulatory uncertainty and potential legal challenges

            Overall, the adoption of web3 mobile apps is currently limited by a range of technical, market, and regulatory challenges. These challenges will need to be addressed in order for web3 mobile apps to become more widely used and adopted.

## Where can I use DID's?

It is possible that DIDs (decentralized IDs) could eventually replace traditional forms of authentication, such as username and password combinations, in the future. DIDs are a key component of the decentralized identity (DID) ecosystem, which is being developed to provide individuals and organizations with control over their own digital identities and data. DIDs are designed to be secure, decentralized, and interoperable, and can be used to represent a wide range of identity-related information in a secure and decentralized way.

The use of DIDs for authentication has several potential benefits over traditional forms of authentication. For example, DIDs can provide a more secure and decentralized way to authenticate users, as they are stored on a decentralized ledger (such as a blockchain) and can be accessed and verified by anyone with the appropriate permissions. This can help to improve the security and privacy of online authentication, and can reduce the risk of identity theft and other security threats. DIDs can also be more user-friendly and convenient for users, as they can be easily accessed and managed using a variety of different devices and applications.

## How large is the Cosmos ecosystem?

The exact size of the Cosmos ecosystem is difficult to determine, as it includes a wide range of projects, applications, and stakeholders. However, the Cosmos ecosystem is generally considered to be one of the largest and most active communities in the decentralized technology space, and it continues to grow and evolve over time, **and recently passed Ethereum in daily development activity.**

## What was the Internets original vision?

Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has expressed a vision for the future of the internet that emphasizes decentralization, interoperability, and user control. In this vision, the internet would be a more open, transparent, and democratic platform, where users have more control over their own data and online experiences.

Berners-Lee has referred to this vision as the "POD" (Personal Online Data) model, and has described it as a way to "take back the web" from the large technology companies that currently dominate the internet landscape. In the POD model, users would be able to store their own data on personal servers or other decentralized storage systems,
and would be able to control who has access to that data. This would enable users to have more control over their own data and online experiences, and would help to reduce the concentration of power and control in the hands of a few large technology companies.
