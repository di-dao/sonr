The Sonr object module is used to store the records of verifiable objects for a specific application powered by the Sonr Network. Each record contains an `ObjectDoc` which describes the type definition of the associated object.

## Overview

The record type utilized in the **Object module** is the `WhatIs` type. This type provides both an interface to utilize VerifiableCredentials and modify the ObjectDoc type definition

## Usage

> Blockchain Methods supplied by Object Module. Full implementation is still a work in progress.

### `CreateObject()` - Register's a new type definition for a given application

```Text
- (`string`) Creator            : The Account Address signing this message
- (`Session`) Session           : The Session for the authenticated user
- (`string`) Label              : Name of the Object defined by developer
- (`string`) Description        : Description of the object defined by developer
- (`List`) InitialFields        : List of the initial `ObjectField`s to create
```

### `ReadObject()` - Returns the WhatIs record for a provided object

```Text
- (`string`) Creator                : The Account Address signing this message
- (`Session`) Session               : The Session for the authenticated user
- (`string`) Did                    : The DID of the object to read
```

### `UpdateObject()` - Changes the configuration of the verifiable object

```Text
- (`string`) Creator            : The Account Address signing this message
- (`Session`) Session           : The Session for the authenticated user
- (`string`) Label              : Name of the Object defined by developer
- (`string`) Description        : Description of the object defined by developer
- (`List`) AddedFields          : List of the `ObjectField`s to add
