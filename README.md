## Status

- [X] __Alpha__: Closed testing.
- [X] __Private Devnet__: May have kinks. [See projects](https://sonr.io/dashboard).
- [ ] __Public Testnet__: Stable for non-enterprise use. [Join it](https://sonr.io/dashboard).
- [ ] __Mainnet__: Coming soon. [Watch status](https://sonr.io/docs/guides/getting-started/features#feature-status).

We are currently in transitioning to Public Testnet. Watch [releases](https://github.com/sonrhq/core/releases) of this repo to get notified of major updates.

## How it works

Sonr is a combination of decentralized primitives. Fundamentally, it is a peer-to-peer identity and asset management system that leverages DID documents, Webauthn, and IPFS â€” providing users with a secure, portable decentralized identity.

Sonr is built on top of the Cosmos SDK, which is a framework for building blockchain applications in Golang. We use these modules:

- `x/auth`
- `x/bank`
- `x/distribution`
- `x/ibc`
- `x/ibc/applications/transfer`
- `x/gov`
- `x/params`
- `x/slashing`
- `x/staking`
- `x/upgrade`
- `x/wasm`

### Architecture

Sonr is a [blockchain node](https://sonr.io/dashboard) which you can run locally, or use to join our testnet. You can sign up and start using Sonr without installing anything using our [dashboard](https://sonr.io/dashboard).

See [additional details](https://sonr.io/docs) on these components.

### Client libraries

Our approach for client libraries is uniform. Abstract away any blockchain specific details, and provide a simple interface for developers to use. We have a few client libraries that we maintain, and provide [guidelines](https://sonr.io) for community maintained libraries.
