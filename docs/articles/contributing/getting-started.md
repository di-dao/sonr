## Dependencies

To get started contributing to Sonr, you'll need a few tools:

- [Task](https://taskfile.dev), a task runner.

  If you have Go installed, [installing Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation) is as easy as running:
 
- [Ignite CLI](https://docs.ignite.com/), a CLI tool for managing Cosmos-based blockchains.

```bash
go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest
```
