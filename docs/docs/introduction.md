Imagine a world where you can sign up to get a driver's license for the internet. This driver's license would be encrypted on the Sonr network blockchain retaining a record book of all your devices and data quickly guaranteeing you universal validity. Only you will be able to access your record book with your driverâ€™s license.

When signing into a traditional application you have probably been asked to sign in with Google or Facebook. Your internet driverâ€™s license would be able to sign you in just as easily!

But beyond sign-in, your driverâ€™s license could directly contact every other driverâ€™s license on earth in real-time allowing you to exchange files, money, messages, contracts, and anything digital with other driverâ€™s licenses. Since your driverâ€™s license would be encrypted on a blockchain your exchanges will become quicker and more secure than typical cloud storage that is prone to hacks.

Soon you wonâ€™t even have to imagine it!ðŸš€


# Overview

Sonr is a data delivery protocol that integrates Identifiers, Discovery, and Transmission for a seamless Web3 experience.

With Sonr, you can easily share any type of data across the world with the ease of use of Airdrop. When you install the Sonr wallet or Sonr enabled DApp, the device becomes a peer on the Network.  It can talk to other peers, and call functions on them - kind of like [Serverless Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing).

Prior to interacting with the network, you register your verified `.snr` subdomain. From your SName, *(i.e. jony.snr) *you become accessible by other Peers on the Sonr Network. This is the central point of access from where you can receive files, money, or any arbitrary data - it's also where you can showcase your content with DApps.

:::hint
**For Example,** let's say there is an Instagram type DApp on Sonr called *'DGram'. *To access the user's page you would access `example.snr/dgram`* - *where everything is **resolved automatically**.

See DApps for more details.
