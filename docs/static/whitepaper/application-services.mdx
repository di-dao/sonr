description: The x/service Module of Sonr's system plays a crucial role in managing and authenticating user interactions with the network.

The Service module provides several key functionalities, including WebAuthn-based user authentication, Service Record management and registration, and DNS resolution and record verification.

## DNS Record Verification
The most basic cryptographic mechanism employed by Sonr is for TXT record verification of origin urls. In order for a service to have the ability to engage with the Sonr network the client needs to deploy a Service Record with a valid, resolvable origin url. The validator node provides the client with a challenge in order to verify ownership of the domain and to insert as a record on their domains DNS routing table. This mechanism is subject to change, as the Sonr core team lookâ€™s for a more scaleable, decentralized approach.

## Verifiable Random User Assertion
A VRF operates like a regular hash function, but with an added feature: it provides a proof of the randomness. This proof ensures that the random number was generated by the specific private key holder and could not have been tampered with or predicted in advance.

When a user requests assertion options from a validator node in the Sonr network, the VRF is employed to generate a challenge. This challenge is unique, unpredictable, and cannot be precomputed or reused. The output from the VRF is used to create the challenge, and a corresponding proof is generated.

The proof and the challenge are then sent back to the user. The user verifies the proof against the validator's known public key before continuing. This way, the user can be assured that the challenge was created freshly by the validator and has not been tampered with during transit.

The challenge is kept private, providing privacy to the user's authentication activity. Simultaneously, the deterministic nature of the VRF ensures that any disputes can be resolved, as anyone can use the proof and the validator's public key to confirm the challenge's correctness.
