## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Sonr aims to be the most immersive and powerful DWeb experience for both Users and Developers alike. We believe the best way to onboard the next billion users is to create a cohesive end-to-end platform that‚Äôs composable and interoperable with all existing protocols.

For a more in-depth technical look into the Sonr ecosystem please refer to the [Architecture Decision Records](./docs/architecture/GUIDE.md).


## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#üöÄ-deployment-a-name--deploymenta) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Ignite CLI](https://github.com/ignite/cli)
- [Protocol Buffers](https://grpc.io)

### Installing
TODO: A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
TODO: Insert Simulation Tests for Blockchain and Unit Tests

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
TODO: Insert gofmt check

```
Give an example
```
