## Abstract
Existing mechanisms for user identity with their lack of standardization have led to faulty solutions that source information from closed third-party sources. By introducing a new peer-to-peer network we solve this issue at the point of the device and leverage a blockchain system to verify User claims. Sonr provides the utility of managing crypto assets, private identifiable information, and application specific data while having full W3C Decentralized Identifier compliance.


Sonr is a Cosmos powered blockchain which is powered by a TenderMint validation mechanism. The default consensus for TenderMint is DPoS and works with our current ABCI implementation for Transaction Verification. DPoS is a twist on Proof of Stake consensus that relies upon a group of delegates to validate blocks on behalf of all nodes in the network . Witnesses are elected by stakeholders at a rate of one vote per share per witness . Coin age is irrelevant. All coins that are mature will add the same staking weight (usually 1 in the wallet hover display) Results in stable, consistent interest only for active wallets and only with small inputs.

## Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

- The token must already have value
- Allocating power or influence via staking gives major edge to wealthy users
- They are frequently subject to gaming and coordination problems

However there is substantial benefit in incorporating a staking mechanism, with the following criteria met we can create a sustainable design:

1. The upfront capital required to stake should not significantly discourage them to stake
2. If a stakeholder group is making decisions that materially harm the network, they would be punished via slashing the stake.
3. Stakeholders can make decisions that positively impact the future network health and token price, therefore holding stake can promote positive Sonr growth
